# RSS Aggregator with GO

The purpose of this project is to build an RSS Aggregator using GO for the backend and PostgreSQL as the database. RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication and is an application that collects RSS feeds from multiple sources and displays them in one place.
An RSS feed is an online file that contains information about a website's published content. It can include details like the content's full text or summary, publication date, author, and link.
RSS feed's data is written in XML and an RSS Aggregator will automatically collect all the posts from those feeds and save them into the database.
Then we can view the feeds and display them when / how we want using our own frontend program (currently no front end is created for this project).

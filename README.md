#RSS Aggregator with GO
Purpose of this program is to build an RSS Aggregator.RSS strands for Really Simple Syndication and is an application that collects RSS feeds from multiple sources and displays them in one place.
An RSS feed is an online file that contains information about a website's published content. It can include details like the content's full text or summary, publication date, author, and link.
RSS feed's data is written in XML and an RSS Aggregator will collect different RSS feeds and add it to its database. 
Then it will automatically colellect all the posts from those feeds and save them into the database. Then we can view the feeds and display them when / how we want.
We use postgreSQL for the database.
